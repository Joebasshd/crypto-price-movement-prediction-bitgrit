This project is for the Crypto Currency Price Prediction Challenge hosted by bitgrit, a company known for data science competitions and emerging Web3 technology. They recently announced their own token, BGR, aimed at enhancing user experiences on their platform. To celebrate this launch, they held a challenge focused on predicting cryptocurrency prices. The challenge asks: **"Will the price of a specific cryptocurrency (not named) rise or fall in two weeks?"** 

Essentially, the goal of the challenge is to predict whether the value of the crypto asset rises or falls in a two week window.
